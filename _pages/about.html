I'm a fourth-year PhD student in department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at University of California, Berkeley,  where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href = "https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Zuo-Jun Max Shen</a>.
Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics and Industrial Engineering & Management Science from Northwestern University in 2020.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My research centers on pricing problems in the context of strategic consumer behaviors, particularly reference effects. I seek to provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights with techniques from online learning, game theory, and sequential decision-making.
